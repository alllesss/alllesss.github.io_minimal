# Hello
It's been over 3 years since I had a growing interest in Modularity and fragmentation. I'm starting to take this idea a bit more serious going forward and the purpose of thise blog is simply to share my thoughts, doubts and ideas that develop over the course of this research openly. Yet, also selfishly it keeps me motivated to put things out there and give more intention to move forward with this work. the format of posts here would differ but for the most part, I see it as a form of a public notebook.

In this first post I want to share a bit of background about this new initiative which shamefully I have no proper title for! I chose "ModularX" the most bland and generic name as a place holder just to have something to refer to. hopefully no god will cast judgment on this poor taste and eventually I will come up with a holy title!

# Modules to represent real spaces [2021-22]
As an artist and engineer working primarily with Unreal Engine, I tend to use it not only for my work as a medium to build simulations and VR experiences but also to visualize upcoming shows. This helped me to get a feel of the space and use it as a soft reference to take decisions on what/how to show different elements of the work. but as time went by I realized I do this quite often and why not make it more streamlined and modular so it takes less labor each time I'll try to make a new space? So what I did was to build the most generic modules that shape the architecture of a space. the only constraint I set was each module should only by max 100cmx100cmx100cm. 
To start all you need is a wall module, and a floor and that's it! this already takes me so far to make a space.

I took it a bit further and took a photo of the grey floor of my old studio in Amsterdam, turned it into a tileable texture and basically sampled the real floor and made it a module.

The rest of the process was basically copy pasting these modules along the floor and walls and ceiling until I get the approximate representation of the real space.

This was of course, the first attempt. a year later I moved to a bigger studio at the Rijksakademie, an attic with a very very strong presense. First thing I did after moving in was to do the same thing, only to realize after a year this space and its modular representation became a part of my film.

Obviously there was something about this modular process that hooked me up. Even though it was only a representation, the fact that the space I was working at was represented with only 3 module types (wood/grey floor/white wall) was satisfying. Even more so perhaps because of the quiteness of this representation it seemed attractive. Could call this 'Syntethic Mirror Space'!
